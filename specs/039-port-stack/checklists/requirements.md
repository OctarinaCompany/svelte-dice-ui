# Specification Quality Checklist: Port Stack Component

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. The Assumptions section unavoidably names upstream file paths and prop/API
  identifiers (e.g. `expandOnHover`, `asChild`) because constitution Principle II requires every
  deliberate divergence from the upstream Dice UI API to be recorded with the exact upstream name
  it replaces and the reason; this is contractual traceability, not an implementation choice
  leaking into the specification's requirements or success criteria.
